# Flashcards-for-the-major-system
Here's a description of the major system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system. I created this program to help me memorize it.

Examples:
$ python main.py

40 > rs
72 > kgn

$ python main.py 2 front

76 > kgshch
71 > kgtd

$ python main.py 2 back

gm > 73
rl > 45

I'm developing this app, it's very simple and, at present, rather clunky.
